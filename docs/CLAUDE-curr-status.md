## Last 3 Finished Tasks
*No previous commits found - this appears to be a new project*

## Started but Not Finished Tasks
1. **FastAPI Web Interface** - Need to create web API endpoints
2. **Gradio UI Implementation** - Need to add demo interface
3. **Comprehensive Documentation** - Need README and API docs

## Current Status
- ✅ Pipeline_Demo.py contains working RAG implementation
- ✅ Structured TODO.md with 6-phase development plan
- ✅ Project tooling setup (Makefile, pyproject.toml, pre-commit, CI)
- ✅ Docs moved to @docs/ directory structure
- ✅ Modular code architecture implemented
- ✅ Basic unit tests written and passing (11/11)
- ✅ Code quality tools configured (ruff, pytest)

## Next Recommended Actions
1. Create src/ directory structure and extract modules from Pipeline_Demo.py
2. Write unit tests for each module
3. Create comprehensive README documentation
4. Set up data directories and configuration
5. Implement FastAPI web interface
6. Add Gradio UI for demo
